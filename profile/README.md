 The official fort.ind org!

> so that you know this is the fort.ind **organization** on GitHub, not the repo

## So what's the site all about, and what does the org have that's different from the existing repo? ðŸ¤”

Fort.ind is a website that I made during the pandemic in 2019. It was a little site at the time, and it was used as an unblocked games site. Over the years, it grew to something that I never knew would be so amazing :D This organization also comes with some extra goodies like the code for the Fort desktop app (BM's version).
